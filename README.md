# How does it work?

## NORMAL MODE

### In normal mode you just have to place the text you want to write automatically

* in the \"text\" area you place the text you want to automate
* in the \"delay\" area you put the time it will take between each keyboard

#### (WARNING: you must take into account that the time is in seconds, so if you put a high delay the task can take too long)
---

## LOOP MODE

### The loop mode works differently, it works for a repetition task (for example writing the same thing many times)

* in the \"text\" area you place the text you intend to repeat
* in the \"delay\" area you place the time it will take between each key
* in the \"loop\" area you place the number of times the process will be repeated
* in the \"special key\" area you can select a special key every time the loop ends

Auto Keyboard is an open source application created in order to practice in my learning journey with python, it is for this reason that there may be things that are not done in the most optimal way, keep in mind that I am learning.
